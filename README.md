# GU ACM WebDev Project

In this project we've come together to build a website for our club that acts as a main hub to introduce the club and provide links to externeal sites
and the activities that we do. As part of the suite of GU ACM Projects, the goal of this project is to make available the opportunity for hands-on experience
in web development for club members and other Gonzaga CS students. 

We are currently using HTML, CSS, and JS for our project. However as the project grows, we anticipate the technology stack to grow with it as well. The website
is currently hosted on a server at our university.
