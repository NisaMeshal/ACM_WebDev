                        Leetcode is an excellent way to improve the skills employers
                        look for in technical interviews.

                        Every fall we host a 12-hour hackathon. It's open to everyone and is a fantastic opportunity to build something meaningful and
                        learning something new in a low-stakes environment. Participants have the opportunity to present their creations at the end of the
                        event to a panel of judges and possibly win a prize as well as definitely improve their professional presentation and pitching skills.
                        There is free food and T-shirts for everyone!
